# Downsamples to generate are determined by computing pixel spacing of source imaging.
# Downsample list used is largest pixel spacing which is smaller than pixel spacing of
# imaging or the smallest pixel spacing if imaging has pixel spacing smaller than what is
# defined.
#
# dict key: value = (pixel spacing (mm/pixel)) : [list of downsamples to gen from source image]
#
# for reference for 40x = 0.00025 mm/pixel
#
# Note: This yaml defines only one downsampling list so it will match all images.
